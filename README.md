# Project Description
PhotoLabs is a React-based Single Page Application (SPA) designed to allow users to view photos in various contexts. We utilize a pre-existing API to build a frontend user experience for interacting with photos.

# Goal
Our primary goal is to build a client-side application using the React view-layer library.

# Features
Users can view all photos in the PhotoLabs database.
Users can view specific photos in the PhotoLabs databse based on their topic selection.
Users can like and like photos of their desire.
Users can click on a photo to open a photo modal to see it larger.
They can seem similar photos in the photo modal.

The PhotoLabs client application utilizes Create React App (CRA), and Express serves as the basis for the PhotoLabs API server application. During development, two servers will be running: the client-side Webpack development server and the API server to provide photo data. Initially, mock data will be used on the front end, and integration with the API server will follow.
